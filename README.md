# Natural_Language_Processing_Projects
This repository contains my personal projects based on Natural Language Processing techniques
1. Parts of Speech Tagging using Hidden Markov Model: Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the syntactic category of a word from the words in its surrounding context. It is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly with high accuracy. Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis (for example, dis-count as a noun vs dis-count as a verb), for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguation. Built a hidden Markov model for part of speech tagging using a "universal" tagset.
2. Machine Translation: The goal of this project is to build a complex neural network based on recurrent neural network to perform language tranformation.
3. Topic Modeling using LDA: Implemented Latent Direclth Distribution for extraction of topics and keywords from dataset
4. Deciphering Code with Character Level RNN: Built a recurrent neural network and train it to decipher strings encrypted with a certain cipher.
